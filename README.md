# Google reCAPTCHA Plugin v3.5 for Zen Cart 15x

Released under the GPL License 2.0.

This Plugin provides Google reCAPTCHA functionality (v2/v3), for optional use on the pages with user-entered forms: Ask A Question, Contact Us, Create Account and Write a Review. It should work for all versions for Zen Cart 1.51 onwards.

## Installation

1. Copy the new files to your test server.
/includes/autoloaders/config.google_recaptcha.php: Loads the observer. Only required for versions of Zen Cart PRIOR to 1.53. From 1.53 onwards it is unused/may be deleted.
/includes/classes/observers/auto.google_recaptcha_observer.php: watches the relevant page(s) with the contact form. This file autoloads from Zen Cart 1.53 onwards.
/includes/functions/extra_functions/functions_google_recaptcha.php: **this file MUST be modified by the user to add the Google Site and Private keys and also to enable/disable the pages to be watched.
/includes/languages/english/extra_definitions/reCaptcha.php : define error message texts for when the captcha is not validated. Note that the text shown on the reCAPTCHA itself is Google-generated.

The following set of files come directly from the Google reCAPTCHA library on GitHub: https://github.com/google/recaptcha

The current version is tag v1.2.4 (newer versions may be available).

All files are unmodified from /src 

/includes/classes/observers/google/autoload.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/ReCaptcha.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestParameters.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/Response.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod/Curl.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod/CurlPost.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod/Post.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod/Socket.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod/SocketPost.php


2. Add the code snippet that generates the Captcha html, to the templates where you want it to display.
````
<?php echo recaptcha_get_html(false, 'light', 'normal', 'margin:5px'); // Google reCAPTCHA ?>
````
This reCaptcha function call has four optional parameters, all four in the above example can be omitted (“margin:5px” is not a default style).
a)	Wrap in a fieldset? false / true. Default is false.
b)	reCAPTCHA theme: light / dark. Default is light.
c)	reCAPTCHA size: normal (rectangular)/ compact (square). Default is normal.
d)	Additional styles for the container. These will not affect the reCaptcha, only the containing div.
Eg:
````
<?php echo recaptcha_get_html(); // no parameters: displays a light, normal-size (rectangular) reCAPTCHA ?>
````
````
<?php echo recaptcha_get_html(true, 'dark', 'compact'); // displays a dark, compact (square) reCAPTCHA surrounded by a fieldset ?>
````
Insert the code in these template files as required.
/includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/templates/tpl_as_a_question_default.php	
/includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/templates/tpl_contact_us_default.php
/includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/templates/tpl_modules_create_account.php
/includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/templates/tpl_product_reviews_write_default.php

Place it next to the submit button.
eg:
````</fieldset>
<?php echo recaptcha_get_html(false, 'light', 'normal', 'margin:5px'); // Google reCaptcha ?>
<div class="buttonRow forward"><?php echo zen_image_submit(BUTTON_IMAGE_SEND, BUTTON_SEND_ALT); ?></div> `
````

3. By default, the reCAPTCHA is disabled on all pages: you need to enable each page in

/includes/functions/extra_functions/functions_google_recaptcha.php

4. An API key pair is required from Google are required to use the reCAPTCHA.

Go to
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create 
and create the Google reCAPTCHA keys for your domain.
Copy and save the two keys somewhere.
A key pair is linked to a specific domain.
You may generate pairs for your production server, local server, development server…etc. All can be placed in the array in the functions file, so the correct pair will be automatically used for the correct domain. This allows testing in different environments (with different php restrictions) without needing to change the pair definitions.

5. Open the functions file for editing: 
/includes/functions/extra_functions/functions_google_recaptcha.php 
Paste the domain name, site and private keys where indicated, and enable the pages where you wish the reCAPTCHA to be used.
 The reCAPTCHA should work with no further configuration necessary.

## Language
The language used in the reCAPTCHA is generated by Google, and based on the shop session language or English.
The error messages are defined in the plugin language file.

## Problems
a)	PHP environment has 'allow_url_fopen' disabled and so 'file_get_contents' does not work. The code will drop to an alternative method using fsockopen.
b)	PHP environment does not have 'fsockopen' available. The code will drop to an alternative method using cURL.
