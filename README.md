# Google reCAPTCHA Plugin v3.8 for Zen Cart

Released under the GPL License 2.0.

This Plugin provides Google reCAPTCHA functionality (v2/v3), for optional use on the pages with public forms such as:  
- Ask A Question
- Create Account
- Contact Us
- Write a Review
- Back In Stock (plugin)

## Compatibility

It should work for all versions for Zen Cart 1.51 onwards. 
Tested through to Zen Cart 2.1 with php 8.3.

## Installation

1. COPY the new files to your TEST server.

`/includes/classes/observers/auto.google_recaptcha_observer.php`

Observer that watches the relevant page(s) that have contact forms, to manage the reCaptcha.

`/includes/extra_configures/google_recaptcha.php`

Configuration file that you **MUST** edit, to add the website address (www.yoursite.whatever), the Google Site key and Private key and also to enable/disable the use of the reCaptcha on individual pages.  The details of this process are described below.

`/includes/functions/extra_functions/functions_google_recaptcha.php`

Functions used by the plugin.

`/includes/languages/english/extra_definitions/reCaptcha.php`

The error message texts shown when the captcha is not validated.  
Note that the text shown on the reCAPTCHA itself is Google-generated.

The following set of files come directly from the Google reCAPTCHA library on GitHub: https://github.com/google/recaptcha

The current version is tag v1.3.0 (newer versions may be available). All files are unmodified from the folder /src.
  
````
/includes/classes/observers/google/autoload.php /includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/ReCaptcha.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestParameters.php /includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/Response.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod/Curl.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod/CurlPost.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod/Post.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod/Socket.php
/includes/classes/observers/google/ReCaptcha/RequestMethod/SocketPost.php
````

2. You must manually insert this code snippet:  
````
<?php //plugin Google reCaptcha
echo recaptcha_get_html(false, 'light', 'normal', 'margin:5px');
//eof plugin Google reCaptcha ?>
````

 ...in the template files where you want the Captcha to display.
 
````
\includes\templates\YOUR_TEMPLATE\templates\tpl_ask_a_question_default.php
\includes\templates\YOUR_TEMPLATE\templates\tpl_contact_us_default.php
\includes\templates\YOUR_TEMPLATE\templates\tpl_modules_create_account.php
\includes\templates\YOUR_TEMPLATE\templates\tpl_product_reviews_write_default.php
p
````
Examples are provided in the plugin's folder: /example template files

This reCaptcha function call has four optional parameters, all four in the above example can be omitted (“margin:5px” is not a default style).
a)	Wrap in a fieldset? false / true. Default is false.
b)	reCAPTCHA theme: light / dark. Default is light.
c)	reCAPTCHA size: normal (rectangular)/ compact (square). Default is normal.
d)	Additional styles for the container. These will not affect the reCaptcha, only the containing div.
Eg:
````
<?php echo recaptcha_get_html(); // no parameters: displays a light, normal-size (rectangular) reCAPTCHA ?>
````
````
<?php echo recaptcha_get_html(true, 'dark', 'compact'); // displays a dark, compact (square) reCAPTCHA surrounded by a fieldset ?>
````
3. By default, the reCAPTCHA is **disabled** on all pages: you need to enable each page in
/includes/extra_configures/google_recaptcha.php

4. An API key pair is required from Google are required to use the reCAPTCHA.

Go to
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create 
and create the Google reCAPTCHA keys for your domain. A key pair is linked to a specific domain.  Copy and save the two keys somewhere.

You may generate pairs for your production server, local server, development server…etc.  
All can be placed in the array in the functions file, so the correct pair will be automatically used for the correct domain. This allows testing in different environments without needing to change the pair definitions and keeping the file identical on all the sites.

5. Open the configuration file for editing: 

````/includes/extra_configures/google_recaptcha.php````

Paste the domain name, site and private keys where indicated, and set to 'true' the pages where you wish the reCAPTCHA to be used.
 The reCAPTCHA should work with no further configuration necessary.

## Language
The language used in the reCAPTCHA is generated by Google, and based on the shop session language or English.
The error messages are defined in the plugin language file.

## Back In Stock Notifications Plugin
https://github.com/torvista/Zen_Cart-Back_in_Stock_Notifications  
Support for Recaptcha is built-into the plugin.

## Problems
a) Triple-check your installation and re-read the documentation.

b) Review the reCaptcha FAQ:  
https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq

c) The reCaptcha does not display: the api.js is not attempted to be downloaded/is not shown in the browser Developer Tools->Network and you have Content-Security-Policy implemented:  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP   
This is mentioned in the reCaptcha FAQ.
You will need to add the exceptions to the CSP Policy either at server or meta-tag level.  
The minimum for the reCaptcha seems to be
````
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' https: 'nonce-{NONCE}' https://ajax.googleapis.com/ https://www.recaptcha.net/;
child-src 'self' https://www.recaptcha.net/">
````
and this will  be additional to whatever is your already-working CSP policies/parameters as in this user example:  
https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?198357-Support-Thread-for-Google-reCAPTCHA-plugin&p=1390588#post1390588

d) If your still cannot get it to work, post in the relevant thread on the Zen Cart Forums - https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?198357-Support-Thread-for-Google-reCAPTCHA 

## Notes
a)	If the PHP environment has 'allow_url_fopen' disabled and so 'file_get_contents' does not work. The code will drop to an alternative method using fsockopen.
b)	If the PHP environment does not have 'fsockopen' available. The code will drop to an alternative method using cURL.

## How it Works
The template file requests the recaptcha html, generated from the recaptcha_get_html function.  
When the user submits the form, there is a POST with the recaptcha data. The header of the file uses a notifier to send that to the recaptcha observer, which validates it.  
On success, global $error is false subsequent to the notifier.  
On failure, global $error contains error message(s). Depending on the page, these are output by messageStack or in the case of BISN, outputted via the XHTML variable-substitution template.
